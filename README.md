# Crownloader

CLI for downloading YouTube videos at the quality you want!

## Installation

You need to go to the [releases page](https://github.com/anventec/crownloader/releases) and download Crownloader and ffmpeg. ffmpeg is used for merging the video and audio files.

Then, you need to put both executables in a single folder, and that would be it. Just open the Crownloader executable and begin to download!
