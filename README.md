# Crownloader

CLI for downloading YouTube videos at the quality you want! Works with long format videos and shorts, doesn't work with playlists, private videos, geo-restricted videos or videos from another platform. Based on [@distube/ytdl-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@distube/ytdl-core)

## Installation

You need to go to the [releases page](https://github.com/anventec/crownloader/releases) and download Crownloader and ffmpeg. ffmpeg is used for merging the video and audio files.
